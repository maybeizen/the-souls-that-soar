Kairo stood frozen in the dimly lit hallway outside the President’s office, his heart pounding in his chest. The hum of the station felt muffled, distant, like the entire world was holding its breath. His mind raced, torn between a thousand thoughts, none of which brought him any comfort. He wasn’t sure what he feared more: the possibility of Rika’s failure or the consequences that would follow her actions if she didn’t back down.

The soft swish of the door opening broke the stillness. Kairo’s breath caught in his throat as he caught a glimpse of Rika stepping inside, her silhouette sharp and determined. The President of Nest-02—an imposing figure whose presence alone could silence a room—sat behind the desk, his back straight, his expression unreadable. The air inside that room was thick with authority, but Rika walked in without hesitation, her pace unbroken.

Kairo held his position in the hallway, unable to move, his body a silent witness to the impending confrontation. He could see her posture, the rigidity in her shoulders, the tension coiling in her every step. This wasn’t just another request; this was a challenge. A challenge she knew would have consequences.

Rika’s voice rang out as she addressed the President, and though her tone was steady, Kairo could hear the faintest tremor underneath, betraying the internal war raging within her.

“Commander,” she said, her words measured but unwavering. “I’m requesting permission to deploy with Kairo.”

For a moment, the room fell into an uncomfortable silence. The President’s piercing gaze flicked between Rika and Kairo. It was as if he was sizing them up, testing their resolve. Then, with a barely perceptible movement, he raised an eyebrow—an expression that could have meant anything, but to Kairo, it felt like the calm before a storm.

“You know the regulations, Ranger,” the President finally said, his voice low and unyielding. “You and Kairo are not cleared for deployment. You’re not partnered, and without that official designation, you are not authorized to enter the field.” His eyes narrowed, assessing Rika as if trying to decide whether her audacity was admirable or a threat. “You’re asking for something beyond your reach.”

Rika didn’t flinch. She stood taller, her fists slowly clenching at her sides, but her resolve did not waver. “I don’t care about your regulations right now,” she said, her voice growing stronger with each word. “The Xhar'kiir are coming, and we have the skills to help. You can’t keep us out of this fight. Not when it matters most.”

The President’s lips tightened into a thin line, his gaze cold and calculating. “This is not a discussion, Ranger,” he replied, his tone a dangerous blend of warning and finality. “Your insistence is noted, but it changes nothing.”

Rika’s jaw tightened, and the words that followed were laced with a strength Kairo had never seen in her before. “I don’t care if you think I’m not ready or that I don’t have a partner. I am ready, and I can do this. The people in that deployment need me. We need to be out there. Not waiting here while others go to fight.”

The President’s jaw tightened visibly, but Kairo noticed something in his eyes—a flicker of something, perhaps recognition or even respect. It was fleeting, and for a moment, the room seemed to hold its breath. The weight of their confrontation was palpable, like a tangible force pressing down on Kairo’s chest.

The President didn’t immediately respond. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking under his weight. His gaze drifted to Kairo for a brief moment, his eyes hard and assessing, before he focused on Rika again.

“Ranger,” he began, his voice quieter now, though still carrying that deep authority. “I understand your passion, and I recognize your determination. But this is not a game. Lives are at stake, and I cannot allow you to act recklessly. You don’t fully comprehend the weight of what you’re asking. Not yet.”

Rika’s gaze never faltered, and the resolve in her voice only grew stronger. “You’re wrong,” she said, taking a step forward. “I understand better than anyone what’s at stake. And I know what I’m capable of. I don’t need your permission to know that I’m ready.” Her voice dropped to a low growl, cutting through the tension in the room. “I’m going out there—with Kairo, or without him—but I’m going.”

The silence that followed felt suffocating. Time seemed to stand still as Kairo felt his heart pounding louder, his pulse racing in his ears. The weight of Rika’s words hung in the air, challenging the very foundation of the President’s authority. And then, at last, the President broke the silence.

“You will return to your quarters,” he said, his voice colder than ever. “There will be no deployment for you today.”

Kairo felt his stomach drop as Rika’s expression faltered, just for the briefest of moments. There it was—the weight of defeat, the weight of someone telling her that she wasn’t enough. But even then, even in that fleeting moment of vulnerability, Rika didn’t break. She remained standing tall, her defiance as strong as ever.

“Then we’ll stay here,” she said quietly, her words almost lost in the tension that filled the room. Without another glance at the President, she turned on her heel and strode toward the door, her movements sharp, purposeful. Kairo hesitated for a heartbeat, torn between staying and following, but in the end, he walked silently behind her.

The return to Wing 07 was heavy, each step feeling like it was leading them deeper into a storm. The atmosphere felt more oppressive now, as if the very air had thickened with unspoken tension. The rest of the squad had deployed, leaving only Kairo, Rika, and Mira behind—three individuals in a world of soldiers, but none with the authority to change their fate.

Inside the common area, Mira was seated on the floor, her back against the wall, her eyes focused on a datapad. She seemed detached, her mind elsewhere. But as soon as Kairo and Rika entered, her gaze shifted toward them, her expression guarded.

"You didn’t get cleared, huh?" Mira’s voice was flat, almost as if she were commenting on the weather rather than the looming crisis.

Rika only nodded, her posture rigid as she muttered, “Not yet.”

The words hung in the air, final and heavy. Kairo felt a knot tighten in his chest, unsure of what to say or how to comfort her. He was left in the same place as Rika—without answers, without choices, and without a way forward.

Mira rose slowly, her brow furrowing as she looked between them. “Don’t let it get to you,” she said, her voice quiet but tinged with something distant, something that didn’t quite match the concern in her words. “You’re not the only ones who’ve been benched. The Xhar'kiir will still be there when they come back.”

Rika’s gaze snapped to Mira, and her face tightened in frustration. “You’re not getting it,” she said sharply, the edge in her tone unmistakable. “We’re not just sitting here because we’re benched. We’re not being given a chance to prove ourselves. We can’t just sit idly by while everyone else goes to fight.” Her voice dropped to a whisper, the weight of her words sinking deep. “This isn’t just about deployment—it’s about us. About being seen. About being worthy of this.”

Kairo knew she wasn’t just speaking about the fight. She was speaking about something deeper, something raw that had been festering inside her for months, maybe even longer. But now wasn’t the time to address it. They didn’t have answers for any of it—not yet. Not until they got their chance.

They would have to wait.
