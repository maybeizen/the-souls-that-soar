The hum of Wing 07 felt more oppressive than usual, a constant reminder of the stillness that had settled in. The rest of the squad had already deployed, leaving only Kairo, Rika, and Mira behind. The hangar was quiet now—almost too quiet—save for the occasional footsteps or the soft buzz of the station’s automated systems.

Kairo sat on the edge of the metal bench, his eyes locked on the door to the hangar. He couldn’t help but replay everything in his mind. The President’s words echoed through his mind: You are not cleared to deploy. Return to your quarters. It felt like an anchor weighing him down, each word another reason to stay still.

Rika, however, was pacing back and forth in the far corner of the room, her fists clenched, shoulders tight. The silence between them was suffocating. After the confrontation with the President, Kairo couldn’t bring himself to look her in the eye. He felt the weight of his indecision like a heavy cloak, but he couldn’t help it. The rules were clear—there was no official pairing, no clearance.

Mira, sitting on the floor near the far wall, had barely said anything since the dismissal. Her eyes stayed focused on the datapad in her hands, though Kairo could tell she wasn’t really reading. She was waiting for something. But what?

Finally, Rika stopped pacing and turned to him, her eyes blazing.

“Are you seriously just going to sit there?” she snapped, the frustration in her voice palpable. “We’re wasting time, Kairo. The Xhar’kiir won’t wait for us. If we don’t act, we’re going to miss our chance.”

Kairo’s chest tightened. He knew she was right, but the fear of defying orders still gripped him. “We don’t have clearance, Rika. We’re breaking protocol. The President won’t let us—”

“To hell with the President!” Her voice cut through the air like a sharp knife. She took a step toward him, her gaze unwavering. “The President doesn’t get to decide who lives and who dies. We do. We have the skill, the instinct, and the will to fight. You’ve seen it before—we’re better together. And I’m not sitting here while everyone else goes to fight.”

Kairo opened his mouth to protest, but the words got stuck in his throat. The fire in her eyes burned away his hesitation, and he could feel the resolve building inside him, just like it had the night they’d flown together back in training.

“What if we’re caught?” he asked quietly, the doubt still clinging to him. “What if—”

“What if we do nothing?” she interrupted, her voice soft but fierce. “Kairo, we’re being sidelined, not because we’re unqualified, but because someone decided we’re not worthy. We’ve never let anyone dictate our worth before, and I’m not starting now.”

Rika was right. The fire in her words sparked something in Kairo—something deep inside him that he hadn’t even realized was there.

He stood up, slowly, almost like it was happening against his will. The weight of the decision still hung in the air, but the hesitation was fading. He couldn’t stay behind. Not this time.

“Let’s do it,” he said, the words barely audible at first. Then louder, with more certainty: “Let’s deploy.”

Rika’s expression softened, but only for a moment. The briefest flash of relief before her face hardened again. “We’ll need to move fast. No time to waste.”

Without waiting for him to respond, she turned and strode toward the exit, her pace steady, like she had already made up her mind a long time ago. Kairo followed, his heart pounding in his chest as they made their way to the hangar.

They moved in tandem, silent, as if the weight of their actions was already starting to settle. They would disobey direct orders, risk everything, and face whatever consequences awaited them. But Kairo knew—deep down—this was the only choice.
