The stillness of the barracks felt unnatural. The dim lighting and the low hum of the Nest's machinery were the only sounds in the air. It was past midnight, a time when most soldiers were either deep in their dreams or on standby. Kairo lay in his cot, eyes closed but not quite asleep. His mind wandered, thoughts drifting from one thing to another—his last mission, the strange tension he'd felt with Rika after their brief flight together, the gnawing sense that something was off.

The cold metal floor under his feet, the sterile smell of the air, the endless rows of cots stretching out in all directions—nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But still, something about the quiet unsettled him.

At 2:03 AM, the stillness broke.

A sharp, shrill sound sliced through the air, jarring him upright in an instant. Wail.

The sirens. His heart immediately stuttered in his chest as the warning blared louder, unmistakable.

The Xhar'kiir were coming.

Kairo's first instinct was to sit up, but his body froze in place. The blaring sirens felt like a crushing weight, suffocating the space around him. He rubbed his eyes, trying to shake the fog in his mind. The Nest's emergency protocols kicked into gear, the urgent announcements blaring over the loudspeakers.

"All personnel—prepare for immediate deployment. Incoming Xhar'kiir assault in T-minus 20 minutes. All pilots report to launch bays."

He took a deep breath, heart still racing. This is it. It’s happening.

But as the urgency of the moment sank in, Kairo's mind flashed to the one thing holding him back. His lack of an official partner. The Xhar'kiir were no longer an abstract threat. They were real, and they were coming fast. The familiar cold hand of anxiety gripped his chest, and a gnawing thought began to eat away at him.

He wasn’t cleared to deploy.

No partner. No flight.

Kairo’s eyes scanned the room, his gaze flicking over the sleeping faces of his fellow soldiers. He could hear the hurried sounds of people scrambling to prepare, grabbing their gear, heading for the exits. But he stayed motionless. I shouldn’t go. Not without a partner. Not officially.

His fingers brushed the edge of his cot, clenching into fists. The one time he'd flown with Rika, back in training—an experience that felt more like instinct than anything else—still lingered in his mind. But they weren’t paired. That brief, chaotic flight had been nothing more than a fluke. The rules were clear: You needed an official pairing. He didn’t have one.

"Dammit," he muttered to himself, glancing at the door, where a soldier passed by, already suited up and ready to go. The panic and fear creeping up on him were suffocating, but they were paired. Officially. They had their names on the roster. Not me.

He could feel his pulse in his throat, the adrenaline beginning to surge. But it wasn’t enough. His mind tugged at him, forcing him to think rationally. He wasn’t supposed to be here. If he didn’t have an official partner, he couldn’t fly. I can’t just ignore the rules.

His hand hovered over the comm system by his bed, ready to request exemption. But then, the sound of footsteps outside the door interrupted his thoughts.

Knock. Knock.

Kairo blinked, startled. The door opened a fraction of an inch before Rika’s face appeared in the small gap. Her eyes were wide, alert, but there was something else there too. Determination. She looked like she’d already suited up, a slight sheen of sweat on her forehead despite the cool air.

“Are you coming?” Rika’s voice was low, urgent. “They’re already gearing up. We don’t have much time.”

Kairo opened his mouth, ready to say something, but the words stuck in his throat. He couldn’t bring himself to respond at first. There was too much riding on the decision, and part of him wanted to just stay back. He was breaking protocol—everything he’d been taught—to follow her. But the thing was, he couldn’t tell her that. Not now.

“Rika, I…” He shook his head. “I’m not cleared for this. I don’t have a partner. I—”

Rika stepped into the room, the door swinging open. She didn’t wait for him to finish. She didn’t need to.

“You and I both know the rules don’t matter right now,” she said firmly, her gaze unwavering. “We’ve flown together before. We can do it again. If we wait for clearance, we’ll miss our window. Are you really going to let that happen?”

Her words hit him hard, making his chest tighten with something that wasn’t quite fear—more like a burning sense of urgency. He didn’t even think before his feet were moving, following her to the door, his mind still scrambling to process what was happening.

But deep down, Kairo knew. This was it. The moment to act had arrived, and he wasn’t going to let it pass him by.
