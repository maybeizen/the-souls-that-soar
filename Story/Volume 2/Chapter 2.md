The halls of Wing 07 were bustling with activity now, the early morning chaos fully alive as soldiers scrambled to prepare for deployment. The usual order and calm had disintegrated into a frenzy.

Kairo’s chest was tight, his boots clicking loudly on the metal floor as he followed Rika, who moved with purpose ahead of him. His thoughts were a whirlwind, but there was no time to focus on them. The mission came first. The Xhar'kiir were coming.

Rika didn’t look back at him as she moved, her every step sure and confident. She had always been like this—driven, capable—but tonight it felt different. There was a certain intensity to her movements, a determination Kairo hadn’t seen before.

They approached the briefing room, where the rest of the pilots had already gathered. A few soldiers glanced up when they entered, but no one spoke. The atmosphere was thick with tension. Kairo’s eyes met a few of their gazes before quickly looking away. He wasn’t supposed to be here.

When they reached the door, Rika didn’t hesitate. She pushed it open and walked in, her pace never faltering. Kairo stood frozen in the doorway for a moment, but then the sound of the comms, the soft hum of the briefing room, the overwhelming sense of urgency pulled him forward.

Inside, the Commander was already standing at the front of the room, his hands clasped behind his back, his eyes cold and calculating. His gaze immediately fell on Kairo and Rika, assessing them with the kind of precision only a seasoned officer could manage.

“You’re not on the roster,” the Commander said, his voice low but firm, carrying the weight of authority. “You’re not even cleared for deployment.”

Rika didn’t flinch. She held her ground. “Does it matter right now? We need to fly.”

The Commander’s eyes flicked over to Kairo, then back to Rika. The tension in the room was palpable, but Rika didn’t back down. Neither did Kairo.

He could feel the weight of the decision pressing on him, but in that moment, standing beside her, he knew there was no turning back. The rules, the clearance—they didn’t matter. Not when the enemy was at their doorstep.

Kairo took a step forward, his heart pounding as he stood beside Rika, ready to face whatever came next.

The Commander’s eyes narrowed, his expression unreadable. “Return to your quaters.,” he said after a long pause. “You are not cleared to deploy.”
