The hangar, illuminated only by the soft light of the overhead strips, felt like a different world after the sun had set. The outer world was a barren, lifeless landscape, a wasteland scarred by the endless war with the Xhar’kiir. But here, inside the heart of Nest-03, the Valkyrian Wings remained untouched, shining like the last flickers of a dying flame.

Kairo stood by his Valkyrian Wing, eyes narrowed as he inspected the sleek, mechanical marvel that had become his constant companion. It had been a routine he’d followed for months now—checking every system, ensuring every inch of his jet was in working order. No matter that it was decommissioned, no matter that it wasn’t going to be used for battle again. It was his, and it held memories too precious to let fade.

His hand hovered over the control panel, fingers brushing over the familiar buttons. It was like muscle memory at this point, the soft hum of the systems bringing a sense of comfort, something he had sorely lacked since the loss of his family, his squadmates, and his place in the world. The war had taken everything from him, but this Wing... it was something he could still hold onto.

“Rika.”

The voice broke the stillness of the hangar like a wave crashing against a wall. Kairo turned to see Rika standing a few feet away, her figure framed by the dim lighting. She wasn’t touching her Valkyrian Wing, not the way Kairo was with his. She stood with her arms crossed, her gaze fixed on the ship in a way that suggested her mind was a million miles away.

He hesitated before speaking again. “You’re still up. You usually head to bed by now.”

Rika didn’t answer at first. Instead, her gaze shifted toward the silent Valkyrian Wings, her brow furrowed in thought. Then, with a faint shrug, she replied, “Couldn’t sleep.”

Kairo felt a flicker of something—a shared understanding. Maybe it was the quiet isolation they both shared, the burden of the past weighing on their shoulders like chains. He gave her a small, understanding nod. “Yeah. I get that.”

For a moment, neither of them spoke. The only sound was the low hum of the Valkyrian systems, the occasional creak of the hangar’s support beams. It felt like the weight of the world hung between them, a tension neither of them could name.

Finally, Rika broke the silence, her voice quiet, almost too soft to hear. “I used to do this too, you know... check my Valkyrian, I mean.”

Kairo looked up, surprised by her words. “You?”

“Yeah.” Rika’s eyes flickered to her Wing before turning back to him. “Back when I was stationed in Nest-04. I was... alone. The whole time. I didn’t have a partner, not until Alec. I handled my Wing by myself. I didn’t need anyone.” She scoffed bitterly, as if the very idea of needing anyone was foreign to her. “But Alec... Alec changed that. He was my Anchor. He was supposed to be my partner. We were good together... until I wasn’t enough.”

The words hung in the air, heavy and filled with a grief that Kairo couldn’t fully grasp, but could still feel seeping into his bones. Alec. She’d spoken of him before, but hearing the pain in her voice this time made it real. The loss, the regret, the silence left in the wake of a death that had been her fault. It was a wound Kairo had never seen, but now it bled through her words, making her seem even more distant than she’d been before.

Kairo wanted to say something—anything—to ease the pain in her voice. But before he could form the words, Rika turned away, her eyes shifting to her Valkyrian Wing. She reached up, running her fingers along the smooth surface of the craft, her movements slow and deliberate.

“I should’ve been faster,” she murmured. “If I had been faster, Alec would still be here. I wasn’t enough to save him.”

Kairo took a cautious step toward her, unsure if his presence would help or make things worse. But there was something in her words that made him want to reach out, to somehow fill the emptiness she felt. “Rika, it wasn’t your fault,” he said gently.

She laughed, but it wasn’t a laugh that reached her eyes. “You don’t understand, do you?” She turned to face him, her eyes fierce with emotion, but there was also something else there—something raw and vulnerable. “I’ve lost everyone I’ve ever cared about. Every partner I’ve had. They’ve all died, Kairo. And I’m left here, still alive, with the weight of their deaths on my shoulders. The guilt... it never goes away.”

Kairo stood there, rooted to the spot, unsure of how to respond. He wanted to reach out, to hold her, but he knew better than to cross that line. Rika was a fortress, a wall she’d built around herself so high that even the strongest storms couldn’t tear it down.

“I’m not the person you think I am,” Rika continued, her voice low but steady. “I’m not some... fearless warrior. I’m just a pilot, Kairo. Just someone who’s trying to survive. And sometimes, I wonder if I’m even worth it. If I even deserve to be here.”

Kairo didn’t say anything for a long while. He let the silence settle between them, and for a moment, it felt like the entire hangar was holding its breath. Finally, he spoke.

“You don’t have to be anyone but yourself, Rika. I don’t care what happened before. I don’t care about your past.” He stepped closer to her, closing the distance between them just a little. “You’re here now. That’s what matters. You’re not alone anymore.”

For the first time, Rika seemed to hesitate. She looked at him, really looked at him, as though she were seeing him for the first time. There was a flicker in her eyes—something vulnerable, something that made Kairo’s chest tighten with the weight of her pain.

And then, without another word, she climbed into the cockpit of his Valkyrian Wing.

Kairo stood frozen for a moment, unsure of what was happening. Rika’s movements were swift and fluid as she slid into the Heart position. She hadn’t even hesitated. It was almost as if she had needed to do this—to confront the memories that had haunted her for so long.

He stood there, watching, his mind racing. His heart pounded in his chest as he walked toward the cockpit. He didn’t know why he was doing this—why he felt the need to follow her into that space—but something in him told him it was right.

Kairo climbed into the Anchor seat behind her, taking his place at the controls. The cockpit was cold and silent, the only sound the soft hum of the Valkyrian systems powering up. He could feel the weight of the past bearing down on them, the shared pain between them pressing against his chest like a vice.

Without words, they sat in silence, both of them lost in their memories. The cockpit was a place of power, of unity, but also of danger. It wasn’t supposed to be a place where you opened up to someone. It wasn’t supposed to be a place where you relived the ghosts of your past.

But as they sat there, Kairo felt it—the pull between them. It wasn’t a drift, not yet. They weren’t synced. But in that cockpit, for the briefest of moments, it felt like they were together. The walls between them—her pain, his grief—seemed to dissipate, if only for a second.

He reached out, his hand brushing against hers. She stiffened, but didn’t pull away. It was enough. It was more than he had hoped for.

“We’ll get through this,” Kairo whispered. “Together.”

And for the first time in what felt like a lifetime, Rika didn’t push him away. She didn’t turn her back or shut him out. She simply nodded, her grip tightening around the controls. And for that one, fleeting moment, they were no longer just pilots—they were two souls, lost in the vast emptiness, trying to soar together.
