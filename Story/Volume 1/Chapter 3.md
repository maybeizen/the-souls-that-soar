Rika Asakura sat at the edge of the mess hall, her fingers wrapped loosely around a cup of tea that had long gone cold. The noise of the room buzzed around her—laughter, voices, the clinking of utensils—but it felt distant. She was used to this kind of isolation, even in a room full of people. She had learned to fade into the background long ago, to become invisible in spaces where others thrived.

It wasn’t that she disliked the team. Far from it. It was just... hard. To be seen, to be understood, to become part of something again. Especially when she had spent years flying solo.

Her mind wandered back to the past—back to when the weight of her mind was shared with no one. Nest-04 had been her sanctuary for years, where she stood apart from everyone else. Unlike the other Valkyrian pilots who needed to work in pairs, Rika had always piloted alone. The sheer capacity of her neural compatibility with the Valkyrian system had made it possible. Where other pilots had struggled to synchronize, Rika’s mind had been able to carry the entire load of the mech—weapon systems, defense protocols, navigation—everything. Alone. She could do it all, and she did it well. Too well.

It earned her the title of "special case." But it also earned her loneliness.

In the mess hall, the rest of Wing 07 moved in their familiar, comfortable rhythm. There was laughter between Kairo and Daichi, soft words of encouragement from Aya to Taz. Everyone knew their place, their roles, their bonds. And Rika? Rika was the outlier. The replacement. The girl who could do it all but never needed anyone.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a chair scraping across the floor. Kairo Takeda, who had been quietly sitting at the other end of the room, was now standing beside her. He held a tray of food, though he seemed less interested in eating than he was in the silent company.

“You look like you could use a distraction,” Kairo said, his voice light but without the usual playfulness. His dark eyes, steady and calm, met hers.

Rika didn’t answer right away. She didn’t have to. He was right. She was used to being alone, but tonight, something about being alone in a room full of people felt... heavier. She didn’t want to admit it, but it was true.

“What do you want, Kairo?” Rika asked, her voice blunt, as always.

Kairo just shrugged, his gaze not wavering from hers. "Nothing. Just thought I'd offer you a seat."

Rika wasn’t sure why, but she found herself watching him for a moment longer than necessary. Kairo wasn’t like the others. He didn’t pester her with questions or try to draw her out of her shell with pleasantries. He just... waited.

“I’m fine,” she said finally, her tone flat, though not quite as harsh as she intended. “I don’t need company.”

Kairo just smiled, a small, knowing smile, and sat down anyway. "Suit yourself, then."

The quiet stretched on between them, the hum of conversation at the far end of the room nearly drowned out by the silence they shared. Rika tried to focus on the food in front of her, the half-eaten meal she had barely touched, but her mind was elsewhere—drifting back to memories of Nest-04, of the days when everything was simpler, when she only had herself to rely on.

Before the war had taken its toll on humanity, before the Valkyrian program had evolved, Rika had been part of the elite squadron stationed at Nest-04. That was back when the Valkyrians were still considered humanity’s best weapon, when the world was still relatively safe, and pilots were paired according to their compatibility. But that wasn’t her reality. Rika had never been paired. She had never had to share the mental strain with another pilot. She had always piloted alone, and it had been both her greatest strength and her deepest curse.

She had flown countless missions, and she had saved more lives than she could count. But every victory had come at the cost of something else—some shred of humanity lost in the coldness of the cockpit. Each mission, each fight against the Xhar’kiir, had been another reminder of her isolation.

When the order came to decommission Nest-04, the loss had been immense. Not just for her team but for Rika herself. She wasn’t part of the replacement program, nor was she part of the new Valkyrian squads. The war had decimated the ranks, and with her neural capacity, she was deemed too valuable to let go.

They had relocated her to Nest-03. Wing 07.

It wasn’t her choice. Not by a long shot.

But the universe had its reasons.

Her thoughts were broken again, this time by the sound of footsteps. Kairo had returned from the mess line, holding a fresh drink in his hand, and he placed it down in front of her. “You’ve been staring at that cup for the last ten minutes,” he said with a raised eyebrow.

Rika glanced at the cup, then at him. She didn’t need to explain herself, but somehow, the way Kairo looked at her made her feel like she wanted to.

“You’re new here,” she said bluntly, her eyes narrowing slightly. “And I’m just the replacement.”

Kairo didn’t flinch, didn’t look away. He sat back down without a word, letting the silence settle again. “You’re more than that,” he said after a long pause. “Maybe you don’t need anyone else, but that doesn’t mean no one wants to be there for you.”

Rika looked at him, her gaze cold but not unkind. “I’ve had enough of that,” she replied, a tinge of bitterness slipping through. “People try, but they don’t last. I’ve been through this before.”

He didn’t push, didn’t insist. Instead, he leaned back, glancing toward the rest of the squad. “Yeah, I get it. But you’re not alone anymore.”

Rika’s chest tightened at his words. She wasn’t used to this kind of openness, this unspoken challenge to her carefully constructed walls. She wasn’t sure whether to push him away or lean in. But for the first time in a long while, the idea of leaning in didn’t seem so terrifying.

Later that night, she found herself walking down to the hangar, a place that had always been a second home to her. The metal floors of the hangar hummed under her boots as she approached her Valkyrian Wing. She reached up to touch the cool metal, her fingers brushing against the surface. The cockpit, as always, was waiting. Her mind instinctively searched for the familiar hum of the systems, the rhythm of the machines.

But for once, it felt different. Less like a machine and more like something... alive. Something that could actually understand her. She didn’t know why she was thinking this now, but there was a growing sense of possibility.

A soft footstep echoed behind her, and Rika turned to see Kairo standing in the doorway. He didn’t say anything at first, just looked at her.

“It’s not just you anymore, Rika,” he said finally. “You don’t have to carry this all alone. Let us in. Let me in.”

Rika felt her chest tighten, but this time, it wasn’t with the usual defensiveness. It wasn’t with anger or bitterness. This time, it was the quietest stirrings of something more. Something that had been buried deep for so long that she barely recognized it.

She didn’t answer immediately. She didn’t need to. She simply stepped forward and climbed into the cockpit, her fingers hovering over the controls. Kairo stayed, watching from the doorway, waiting.

Rika didn’t speak as she powered up the systems, but as the familiar hum filled her ears, she felt something stir in her chest. It wasn’t a promise or a guarantee. But maybe, just maybe, she was ready to let someone else in.
