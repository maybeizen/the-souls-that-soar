# **The Souls That Soar (Maiagaru Tamashii)**

## **Overview**

_The Souls That Soar_ is a sci-fi action-romance story set in a dystopian future where humanity faces extinction at the hands of an alien race known as the _Xhar’kiir_. Fueled by the discovery of a mysterious energy source, _Aetherion_, humanity’s survival depends on elite fighter pilots who control Aetherion-powered jets, the _Valkyrian Wings_. The story weaves together themes of love, loss, and sacrifice as the pilots confront not only their alien foes but also the secrets hidden in humanity's desperate war.

## **Setting**

In the aftermath of the alien _Xhar’kiir_’s war declaration, Earth unites under the _United Earth Coalition (UEC)_. The conflict begins when humans mine _Aetherion_, a powerful energy source discovered beyond the solar system. While Aetherion accelerates humanity’s technological advances, it also draws the ire of the _Xhar’kiir_, who perceive humanity’s exploitation of the resource as a universal threat.

The UEC develops the _Valkyrian Wings_, large, advanced fighter jets that require two synchronized pilots:

- A male _Anchor_, responsible for navigation and defense.
- A female _Heart_, the energy conduit and emotional synchronizer.

Adolescents selected as pilots train in squads called _Wings_ within barracks known as _Nests_. Each _Wing_ consists of eight pilots, forming a tightly-knit team to defend Earth against its alien adversaries. Each _Nest_ contains 4 _Wings_. _Nests_ are located in secure, underground bunkers.
