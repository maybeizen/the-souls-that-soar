Kairo sat on the wing of his decommissioned Valkyrian Wing, Eclipse Prime, the once-proud jet now reduced to a relic of war. The cool metal beneath him was weathered and scarred, streaked with the soot of battle and etched with jagged gouges from close calls and desperate maneuvers. His fingers traced one of the deeper scars along the hull, the rough edge catching against his calloused skin. Every scratch, every dent had a story. Stories he wished he could forget.

His mind wandered, unbidden, to the last battle—the one that had nearly destroyed him. No matter how hard he tried to push the memories away, they surged back like a tide. The roar of the engines. The warning alarms blaring in his ears. And Mira’s voice—calm and steady at first, her instructions cutting through the chaos, until the Xhar’kiir hit them harder than expected. Then, her voice had broken, cracking under the strain, giving way to screams that he could still hear when the nights were too quiet.

His Heart, his copilot, had come so close to death that day. Kairo shut his eyes, but it didn’t help. He could still see her pale, bloodied face as she was dragged from the cockpit, unconscious. Could still feel the bone-deep panic that had gripped him when he thought she wouldn’t survive.

She did. But not without consequences.

The injuries she’d sustained had stolen her ability to pilot, severing the bond they had forged over years of flying together. That bond had been unshakable, unspoken—a connection that couldn’t be replicated. The cockpit without Mira was just a hollow shell, and Kairo without Mira… Well, he wasn’t sure what he was anymore. Eclipse Prime, Mira, himself—everything felt broken. And the pieces didn’t seem to fit back together the way they used to.

The distant rumble of explosions drew him out of his thoughts. Faint but persistent, they reverberated through the air like a heartbeat—steady, inevitable. Somewhere beyond the Nest’s fortified walls, the war raged on. People were fighting, dying, sacrificing. Kairo felt the weight of it pressing against him, urging him to act. But he couldn’t. Not yet. Not when he still felt like this—fractured, unmoored.

He exhaled sharply, the sound cutting through the heavy stillness of the hangar. Standing, he brushed the dust from his uniform. His boots scraped against the jet’s wing as he jumped down to the floor, the impact reverberating through his legs. The hangar felt cavernous and cold, the other Valkyrian Wings lined up like silent sentinels. Most of the squad was out on patrol or prepping for deployment. Kairo had been given leave, though he couldn’t decide whether it was a mercy or a punishment.

The emptiness of the Nest amplified his own sense of isolation. His footsteps echoed softly as he made his way down the dim corridors, heading for his quarters. He kept his eyes down, lost in his thoughts, until a familiar figure appeared ahead of him, nearly colliding with him in the narrow hallway.

“Mira,” he said, startled.

She stopped, lifting her head slowly. The sight of her hit him like a blow. She looked smaller than he remembered, her frame hunched and fragile. Her eyes, once so bright and full of determination, were dull now, lifeless. Shadows clung to her like a second skin, as though the light itself refused to touch her.

Kairo’s heart twisted painfully. He hadn’t seen her in days—not really. She’d been avoiding him, or maybe he’d been avoiding her. It didn’t matter. Seeing her like this, so far removed from the girl he once knew, panged him with guilt.

He had no idea what was going on inside of her, what thoughts were tormenting her behind those hollow eyes. But it was clear something had cracked within her since their last mission. He could sense it—her distance, her silence, the way she no longer looked at him the same way she had before.

There had always been something unspoken between them. A connection that neither of them had fully acknowledged, but had always been there, growing between the adrenaline of their missions and the quiet moments afterward. Kairo had always assumed that Mira’s feelings for him were simple affection. But after that day, after she was pulled from the cockpit, and he was left to navigate the sky alone, he wondered if it was more than that. And now, that unspoken bond between them felt like a weight, something they both carried in different ways.

“Hey,” he said softly, the word hanging awkwardly between them.

Mira blinked, startled by his voice, as if she hadn’t realized he was there. For a fleeting moment, something flickered in her gaze—a spark of recognition, of familiarity. But it faded just as quickly, leaving behind the same hollow emptiness.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered. Her voice was fragile, barely audible, and it cracked on the last word. "I thought I could protect you. That I could be enough for you."

Kairo’s throat tightened. He wanted to tell her she didn’t have to apologize, that none of this was her fault. But the words felt stuck, tangled in the weight of everything he wasn’t saying. He hadn’t realized how deeply Mira’s feelings for him had cut into her.

She thought she had failed him. Maybe more than that—maybe she thought she had failed herself. The guilt in her eyes was palpable, and it tore at him, because he felt the same way. He had always depended on her in the cockpit. And now? Now, he wasn’t sure how to fly without her.

“No,” he said hoarsely, his voice rough with emotion. “It’s not your fault.”

Mira’s gaze dropped to the floor, her shoulders sagging under some invisible weight. “It doesn’t matter,” she said, her tone flat, hollow. “I can’t go back. Not to that.” Her voice trembled, though she tried to hide it.

Kairo’s hand instinctively reached out, but he hesitated. The touch he had once offered as a comfort now felt like a betrayal. He wanted to hold her, to tell her that she hadn’t let him down. But how could he say that when he felt just as lost as she did?

“Mira—” he started, but she cut him off with a shake of her head.

“Don’t,” she said, stepping back. Her voice was quiet but firm, leaving no room for argument. “Just… don’t.”

And then she was gone, retreating into the shadows of the hallway. Kairo stood frozen, his arm still outstretched, as if reaching for the last shred of the person she used to be.

The ache in his chest deepened. He felt guilty for not knowing how to fix things, for not knowing how to make her believe that everything would be okay. But he couldn’t fix this. And that truth sank in like a stone, settling heavy in his gut.

The silence that followed felt suffocating. Kairo turned, his mind still reeling, and continued to his room in silence.

When he reached his quarters, he closed the door behind him and leaned against it, letting out a heavy sigh. The faint hum of the Nest’s machinery filled the silence, but it did little to ease his mind. His gaze drifted to the wall where a photograph hung crookedly, the edges curling from age. It was from before the war—before the last battle, before everything had fallen apart.

In the photo, Mira was smiling, her arm slung around his shoulder. Their squadmates stood around them, laughing and carefree. Kairo clenched his jaw and looked away, unable to face the memory. That version of Mira, of himself, of all of them—it felt like a dream he could never return to.

A low, steady alarm began to blare in the distance, breaking through his thoughts. Kairo’s stomach churned. Another deployment. Another battle. The war was never far away, no matter how much he tried to escape it.

Straightening, he squared his shoulders and stared at the door. Somewhere out there, his squad would be scrambling to their Valkyrian Wings, preparing for yet another fight. And here he was, sitting on the sidelines.

For a brief, fleeting moment, he wondered if there was still a place for him out there, in the skies.
