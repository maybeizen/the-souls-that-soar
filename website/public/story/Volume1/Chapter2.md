The dim lighting of the barracks was a stark contrast to the cold, sterile glow of the hangar. It was late in the evening, but the members of Wing 07 were gathered in the common area, sitting around a worn-out table that had seen too many battles and not enough rest. The mood was somber, as it had been since the last battle. The taste of survival still lingered in the air, and for the first time in what felt like forever, no one had much to say.

Kairo, leaning against the wall near the corner, watched his squadmates as they recounted the details of the mission. His thoughts were elsewhere, still stuck in the echo of Mira’s empty gaze and the sounds of the fight that had nearly destroyed them all. He could hear Daichi joking with Taro about their near-miss with a Xhar’kiir fighter, but it was distant, muffled—like the conversations were happening in another room.

Beside him, Mira sat with her hands clasped tightly together, avoiding the conversations happening around her. Her once vibrant eyes now seemed distant, staring off into space. Kairo’s gaze lingered on her for a moment, but the ache in his chest reminded him to look away. He wasn’t sure what to say anymore.

"I swear, if we hadn't gotten that last shot in, we would've been scrap metal by now," Daichi's voice cut through Kairo's thoughts, his tone half-serious, half-joking.

"I don't know why you always say that," Shiori replied dryly, tapping her fingers on the table. "We were fine. Besides, you never seem to mind when Taz takes unnecessary risks."

"Hey, I never take unnecessary risks," Taz protested, laughing as he leaned back in his chair, his feet propped up on the table.

Kairo half-smiled at the banter, but it faded just as quickly. He couldn’t shake the guilt gnawing at him, the weight of Mira’s injury, the unspoken distance between them all. The squad was still whole, but it felt like they were slipping, losing pieces of themselves that they couldn’t get back.

The sound of footsteps interrupted his thoughts. Kairo turned, his heart giving a strange, unexplainable flutter. A figure stood at the entrance, silhouetted against the light spilling in from the hallway. Her posture was confident, almost defiant, yet there was something vulnerable in her stance—a tension that clung to her.

Rika Asakura, the new addition to Wing 07, stood just inside the door. She wore the standard pilot uniform, but there was something about her presence that immediately commanded attention. Her dark hair was tied back in a tight ponytail, and her sharp, dark eyes scanned the room like a hawk assessing its surroundings. Despite her youthful appearance, there was a hardness in her gaze, an edge that made her seem older than she was.

Kairo’s heart skipped a beat. There was no mistaking it. The moment he laid eyes on her, something stirred deep inside him. He couldn’t pinpoint it—was it attraction? Was it just the quiet intensity she carried with her? He couldn’t say. But it was there, an undercurrent that pulled at him.

Rika’s eyes swept over the squad, a hint of uncertainty flickering in her expression before she masked it with a confident smile. "I’m Rika Asakura," she said, her voice steady, but there was a note of hesitation, as though she was still finding her place among strangers.

"We know who you are," Daichi chimed in, his usual cocky grin spreading across his face. "Renji's been telling us all about you. Welcome to the team. Just don’t think you’re gonna be taking over anytime soon."

Shiori raised an eyebrow. "We’ll see about that," she said dryly. "If you can survive Daichi’s nonsense, you’ll be fine."

Rika chuckled, but there was a quiet edge to her laughter. Kairo observed her carefully, noting how she seemed to carry herself with an unspoken burden. Like she was used to standing alone.

"You’re here to replace Mira?" Taz asked casually, glancing at the girl who had become the squad’s unofficial support. His tone wasn’t unkind, but it held an underlying question—a challenge that, despite being unspoken, Kairo could feel.

Mira flinched at the question, her eyes dropping to her lap. She’d been handling the loss of her ability to pilot with quiet strength, but there were moments when it all seemed to catch up to her.

Rika didn’t seem phased by the question. "I’m here to help," she replied simply. "I’m not here to replace anyone."

Kairo watched her closely, noting the way she held herself, how her gaze didn’t linger too long on anyone. There was a kind of guardedness to her, like she was keeping her emotions locked behind a wall. It reminded him of himself, of how he had withdrawn after Mira’s injury, how he still kept his heart walled off from the pain of losing her.

But for a split second, Kairo saw a flicker of something in Rika’s eyes—a vulnerability hidden beneath the bravado, a subtle fragility that hinted at her own burdens. Her past, her struggles—he wasn’t sure, but it was there. She wasn’t just some new pilot to fill in the gaps.

As he caught her gaze, a strange sense of familiarity washed over him. He couldn’t explain it, but in that moment, Kairo felt as though he had known her for much longer. He quickly looked away, almost embarrassed by the intensity of his own thoughts. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to acknowledge whatever this was, but it was there—a pull that lingered at the edges of his mind.

"Alright, now that we’re all here," Renji’s voice cut through the moment, his usual calmness settling over the group. "Let’s get down to business. We’ve got a lot to prepare for, and we need to start working together as a team."

Rika nodded, her sharp eyes scanning the squad, taking in each of them with a quiet intensity. "Let’s do this."

As the team settled into the familiar rhythms of planning, Kairo found himself scanning the room, his mind drifting. Every so often, his eyes would flicker toward Rika. There was something about her presence that he couldn't shake. Her quiet determination, the way she carried herself with a strength that was at odds with her quiet demeanor—it was captivating.

After the meeting, the squad slowly began to disperse. Daichi and Taz had already started making their way toward the mess hall, chattering about food and what they would do with their downtime. Shiori and Nami were discussing the next training session. But Kairo found himself standing still, watching Rika. It was almost as if she was waiting for something—or maybe for someone.

As if on instinct, he walked over toward her. She was standing near a small window, staring out at the darkened landscape, her arms crossed in a protective gesture.

"You’ll get used to them," Kairo said, his voice breaking the silence.

Rika turned slightly, raising an eyebrow. "I’m sure I will." Her tone was neutral, but Kairo could sense there was something deeper behind her words. She was still adjusting, and that was fine. He was too.

"Renji told us all about your experience," Kairo continued, trying to keep the conversation light. "Sounds like you've been through a lot."

Rika's eyes flickered to him, and for a moment, he saw something in them—something soft, but quickly masked. "Everyone's been through a lot, Kairo," she said, her voice even, but there was a hint of something vulnerable in her words. "But that's the job, right?"

Kairo nodded slowly. The weight of her words hung in the air, and for the first time in a long time, he felt something stir inside him. Something that he hadn't felt since the days he piloted with Mira. The connection. The unspoken understanding between pilots who had seen too much, lost too much, and yet, still pushed forward.

"Yeah," Kairo said quietly, his eyes meeting hers. "That's the job."

For a long moment, they stood in silence, two souls bound by the same burden. Kairo couldn't quite explain it, but something about this simple exchange, this quiet moment of shared understanding, stirred something inside him. He had felt lost for so long, but here, in this brief conversation, there was a flicker of something more—something that felt like hope.

Rika nodded once, almost imperceptibly. "I’ll see you tomorrow, Kairo." She turned and began to walk away, but Kairo stood still, watching her leave.

He wasn’t sure what this meant. He wasn’t sure about anything anymore. But one thing was clear—Rika Asakura wasn’t just another pilot. She was someone he would have to reckon with, in more ways than one.
