The cockpit of the Valkyrian Wing hummed softly around Rika, the faint glow of the instrument panels casting her face in shades of green and blue. Her hand hovered over the controls, fingers trembling slightly as the weight of Kairo’s words hung in the air.

"You don’t have to carry this all alone. Let us in. Let me in."

Why did those words dig into her like that? She had heard variations of them before—from her commanders, from her previous squadmates, even from Alec, her last Anchor. And yet, they had all ended the same way: people trying to help her, trying to understand her, and eventually leaving when they realized she was too much. Too broken. Too solitary.

Her throat tightened as she clenched her jaw, her fingers gripping the controls like a lifeline. The Valkyrian’s neural systems buzzed faintly at the edges of her mind, a sensation she was used to—her thoughts meshing with the machine’s systems, becoming one with it. Normally, it was a comfort, but tonight it felt... suffocating. Too close. Too much.

With a frustrated sigh, Rika powered down the systems. The cockpit lights dimmed, leaving her in near-darkness save for the faint glow of the hangar lights outside. She sat there for a moment longer, her hands still gripping the controls, before finally pulling herself out of the pilot’s seat.

Kairo was still standing in the doorway of the hangar, arms crossed as if waiting for her. His expression wasn’t impatient or judgmental—it was calm, steady, and infuriatingly understanding. That made it worse.

“Rika—” he started, but she cut him off with a raised hand.

“Don’t,” she said sharply, her tone colder than she intended. “I’m fine.”

Without waiting for a response, she brushed past him, her boots echoing against the metal floor as she disappeared into the depths of the Wing.

Rika wasn’t sure where she was going. She just knew she needed to get away—away from the cockpit, away from Kairo, away from the thoughts that had started to claw at the edges of her mind. She wandered the corridors of Nest-03, her steps growing slower and heavier as the weight of it all pressed down on her.

Eventually, she found herself in an abandoned storage room. The space was dimly lit, cold, and filled with the faint smell of dust and oil. She sank to the floor, her back against the wall, and let out a shaky breath. The silence was comforting, a reprieve from the chaos swirling in her mind.

She didn’t remember falling asleep. All she remembered was the quiet, the cold metal beneath her hands, and the faint hum of the Nest’s ventilation system.

The next morning, the squad of Wing 07 was already stirring when Aya Mizuno found Rika. Aya had been searching for spare parts for her Valkyrian Wing and stumbled into the abandoned room by accident. Her sharp intake of breath echoed through the room when she saw Rika curled up on the floor, her arms wrapped tightly around herself.

“Rika?” Aya’s voice was soft, hesitant, as if she were afraid to wake her.

Rika stirred, her eyes fluttering open. For a moment, she looked disoriented, her gaze darting around the room before landing on Aya. She quickly sat up, brushing her hair out of her face and straightening her jacket.

“What are you doing here?” Rika asked, her voice rough from sleep. She hated how vulnerable she felt in that moment, hated that Aya had found her like this.

“I could ask you the same thing,” Aya replied gently, crouching down to meet her gaze. “Are you okay?”

Rika avoided her eyes, standing up and brushing off her uniform. “I’m fine. I just... needed some space.”

Aya didn’t press further, but the concern in her eyes was evident. “Well, breakfast is in the mess hall. Everyone’s waiting.”

Rika nodded stiffly, following Aya out of the room without another word.

The squad had been given a rare day off, and the atmosphere in the Nest was unusually light. Kairo, Daichi, and Taz had taken over the common room, binging an old anime series on the massive holo-screen. Shiori and Nami were cleaning their Valkyrian Wings in the hangar, their chatter and laughter echoing through the space. Renji, ever the stoic leader, was in the simulator, running through tactical scenarios alone.

Rika spent most of the morning avoiding everyone. She stayed in the hangar, methodically cleaning her Valkyrian Wing. It was an easy task, one that didn’t require much thought, and she welcomed the distraction. But even as she worked, she could feel Kairo’s presence nearby. He wasn’t watching her—he was working on his own Wing—but she was hyper-aware of him nonetheless.

Every now and then, he would glance her way, his expression unreadable. Rika pretended not to notice, focusing on the task at hand.

By the afternoon, the squad had regrouped in the common room. Rika found herself sitting on the edge of the couch, her arms crossed as she half-watched the anime playing on the holo-screen. She wasn’t paying much attention to the plot—it was some ridiculous mecha series that Daichi had insisted on watching—but she stayed anyway, her presence a quiet acknowledgment of the team’s camaraderie.

Kairo was sitting across from her, leaning back in his chair with a faint smile on his lips. He didn’t say anything to her, didn’t try to draw her into the conversation or make her feel included. He just... existed, his presence calm and unintrusive. It was oddly comforting.

At one point, Daichi made a ridiculous comment about the anime’s plot, and the whole squad burst into laughter. Rika didn’t laugh, but her lips twitched slightly, almost imperceptibly. Kairo noticed, his gaze softening as he watched her.

As the day went on, Rika found herself spending more and more time around the squad, though she kept her distance emotionally. She helped Shiori and Nami with their Valkyrian Wings, her blunt comments about their technique earning a mix of groans and laughter. She sat through the anime marathon, offering the occasional sarcastic remark when the plot became too absurd.

And though she didn’t say much, she stayed. That was progress, even if she didn’t realize it yet.

Later that evening, as the squad began to wind down, Kairo approached Rika in the hangar. She was standing next to her Valkyrian Wing, her fingers tracing the edge of the cockpit. She didn’t look at him as he approached, but she didn’t walk away either.

“You’re spending more time with us,” he said casually, leaning against the Wing.

“Don’t read too much into it,” Rika replied, her tone clipped.

Kairo chuckled softly. “I’m not. Just... glad you’re here.”

Rika didn’t respond, her gaze fixed on the Valkyrian. But for the first time in a long while, she didn’t feel the need to push him away. She didn’t feel the need to run.

Maybe, just maybe, she could stay a little longer.
