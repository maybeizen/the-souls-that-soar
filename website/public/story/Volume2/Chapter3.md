Kairo sat on the edge of his bunk, staring at the cold metal walls of the quarters. The quiet buzz of the station’s systems hummed in the background, but it felt like a distant noise, like the world was happening somewhere far away and he was stuck in a limbo. His fingers drummed impatiently against his leg, a restless energy coursing through him.

Rika was pacing back and forth across the room, clearly agitated. He could tell she was trying to hold it together, but the tension in the air was thick, suffocating. There was an electricity between them now, an unspoken frustration that neither could shake. They had been dismissed—told they were unfit for deployment. Kairo could understand the reasoning on a technical level, but emotionally? It didn’t sit right with him.

He wanted to be out there with the rest of the squad, facing the Xhar'kiir, fighting for their survival. And Rika—Rika was just as restless, if not more. Her eyes kept darting to the door as if she could will herself back into the action.

Finally, Rika stopped pacing and looked directly at him, her expression hardening. "This is wrong," she muttered, more to herself than to Kairo. She bit her lip, her gaze shifting to the door once again. "We should be with them. They’re going out there without us."

Kairo wanted to say something, to share in her frustration, but words felt useless. They weren't allowed to go. He didn’t want to dwell on it, but the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He wanted to argue, to demand they be allowed to fight. But the Commander’s orders, the President of Nest-02’s restrictions—they held too much weight.

Rika’s voice broke through his thoughts, sharper now. "You know what? I’m not standing down." She turned to him, eyes blazing. "I’m not going to just sit here. Not while the rest of them fight and die."

Kairo raised an eyebrow, not sure if he’d heard her correctly. "You’re seriously going to—"

"Yes," she cut him off, her determination clear. "I’m going to talk to the President of Nest-02."

Kairo’s jaw dropped. "You can’t do that. You know the rules. Nobody dares challenge the President."

Rika's eyes met his, fiery and unyielding. "Then maybe it's time someone did."
